# VPN Comparison: Tailscale vs. MikroTik RouterOS VPN

This document compares **Tailscale** and **MikroTik's built-in VPN options** for remote access and networking in a home lab environment. It highlights the strengths, weaknesses, and use cases for each solution.

## Overview

| Feature | Tailscale | MikroTik RouterOS VPN |
|---------|-----------|---------------------|
| **VPN Type** | Peer-to-peer mesh VPN (WireGuard-based) | Traditional VPN (IPSec, L2TP, OpenVPN, WireGuard, EoIP, etc.) |
| **Connectivity Scope** | Node-to-node; can optionally advertise LAN subnets | Central router gateway; provides access to entire LAN/subnets |
| **Setup Complexity** | Very simple; install client & authenticate | Moderate to complex; requires VPN server setup, keys, firewall/NAT configuration |
| **NAT Traversal** | Automatic | Requires port forwarding or public IP for remote clients |
| **Scalability** | Excellent; mesh network grows easily | Moderate; central VPN server can become bottleneck with many clients |
| **Device Compatibility** | Cross-platform (Linux, Windows, Mac, mobile, containers) | Dependent on supported VPN protocols; legacy devices may require custom config |
| **Performance** | Direct peer-to-peer tunnels → lower latency | All traffic routes through central VPN → potential backflow/double-hop delays |
| **Access Control** | Identity-based ACLs, per-device permissions | Firewall rules and routing define access; manual configuration |
| **Dependency** | Relies on Tailscale control plane (for peer discovery & NAT fallback) | Fully self-hosted; no external dependency |
| **Use Case Best Suited** | Easy remote access, mixed devices, dynamic environments, cloud/home-lab mesh VPN | Site-to-site tunnels, full LAN access from remote, legacy devices, advanced routing/firewall setups |

## Advantages

### Tailscale
- Simple to deploy: install, authenticate, done.
- Peer-to-peer connections minimize latency.
- Automatic NAT traversal; works behind CG-NAT or firewalls.
- Scales easily as more nodes are added.
- Identity-based ACLs for granular access control.
- Cross-platform: works on laptops, servers, mobile devices, and containers.

### MikroTik VPN
- Full control over routing, firewall, VLANs, and subnet access.
- Supports multiple VPN protocols for compatibility with various devices.
- Self-hosted; no reliance on external services.
- Ideal for site-to-site VPNs or accessing all LAN devices from a single tunnel.
- Good for complex or enterprise-style network topologies.

---

## Disadvantages

### Tailscale
- Each node must run Tailscale to be directly accessible.
- Limited control over advanced routing/firewall rules.
- Reliance on Tailscale control plane for peer discovery and NAT fallback.
- Non-Tailscale devices require a subnet router to be reachable.

### MikroTik VPN
- More complex setup: keys, firewall rules, port forwarding, routing.
- NAT traversal behind CG-NAT requires extra configuration.
- Centralized tunnel can create a performance bottleneck.
- Adding new clients requires manual configuration.

## Recommended Use Cases

| Scenario | Recommended Solution |
|----------|--------------------|
| Access individual home lab nodes and services quickly and easily | Tailscale |
| Connect multiple remote clients to entire LAN, including legacy devices | MikroTik VPN |
| Mixed OS environment with laptops, servers, and mobile devices | Tailscale |
| Site-to-site VPN between multiple physical networks | MikroTik VPN |
| Want minimal setup and low maintenance | Tailscale |
| Full control over routing, firewall, and complex network topologies | MikroTik VPN |

## Practical Recommendation for Home Labs

- **If each node is capable of running Tailscale (e.g., Wyse nodes, servers):**
  - Install Tailscale on each node for direct, low-latency remote access.
  - Use the router purely for routing, firewall, and internet connectivity.
- **If you need full LAN access, or have devices that cannot run Tailscale:**
  - Consider using MikroTik VPN to provide a central VPN gateway.
- Combining both approaches is possible:
  - Use Tailscale on nodes for convenience and performance.
  - Keep MikroTik VPN for site-to-site tunnels or legacy device access.

## Using a Single Tailscale Node as a Subnet Router

If you want remote access to devices on your LAN that **cannot run Tailscale**, you can configure a single node (e.g., a Wyse 5070 home lab node) as a **subnet router**. This allows Tailscale to provide VPN access to your entire LAN through one node.

### How It Works

1. Install Tailscale on a single gateway node  
   - Choose a powerful, always-on node (e.g., Wyse 5070 with 32GB RAM).  
   - Install and authenticate the Tailscale client.

2. Enable subnet routing  
   - Configure Tailscale on the node to advertise the LAN subnet. For example, if your LAN is 192.168.88.0/24:  
   sudo tailscale up --advertise-routes=192.168.88.0/24  
   - Approve the advertised route in the Tailscale admin console.

3. Configure MikroTik static routes  
   - On your MikroTik router, add a static route pointing to the Tailscale node as the gateway for the advertised subnet. For example:  
   /ip route add dst-address=192.168.88.0/24 gateway=<Tailscale_Node_IP>

#### Diagram: Traffic Flow Through Subnet Router

Remote Client → Tailscale Network → Subnet Router Node (Wyse 5070) → LAN Devices (non-Tailscale nodes)

**Note:** This example may result in data backflow, where traffic from remote clients to certain LAN devices passes through the subnet router node. This setup is intended for illustration; in production, plan routing carefully to minimize latency and avoid unnecessary hops.

4. Result  
   - Remote devices connected to your Tailscale tailnet can now access all devices in your LAN, including those that do not run Tailscale.  
   - The gateway node handles routing and NAT for non-Tailscale devices.  
   - Other Tailscale nodes or devices do not require additional setup.


### Advantages
   - Provides remote access to the full LAN without installing Tailscale on every device.
   - Centralizes subnet routing on a single, capable node.
   - Keeps the router free from VPN overhead.

### Considerations
   - The subnet router node becomes a single point of entry — it must remain powered and connected.
   - Some traffic may take an extra hop through the subnet router, potentially adding slight latency compared to direct Tailscale connections.
   - Proper firewall rules on the gateway node are recommended to secure LAN access.
