# Distro Choice

When planning this project, I evaluated several Linux distributions, including:

- Fedora  
- Red Hat Enterprise Linux  
- AlmaLinux  
- Rocky Linux  
- Debian  
- Ubuntu  
- Kubuntu  

Ultimately, I decided **not** to spend extensive time comparing distributions in depth. Instead, I chose **Kubuntu** for the following reasons:

- I use Fedora as my daily driver and have experience building a customized Fedora setup (“ricing”) as well as studying on Red Hat Enterprise Linux. While I’m very familiar with the **RPM ecosystem**, I specifically wanted to use a **different package manager** for this project to broaden my experience.
- I have used Debian in the past and did not find it particularly user-friendly. Ubuntu, however, provides a more accessible and polished experience while still retaining Debian’s stability.
- I’m not a fan of the **GNOME** desktop environment, but I’m very comfortable with **KDE Plasma**, which ships by default with Kubuntu.
- I’m aware of the various discussions and controversies surrounding Canonical, but part of my goal with this project is to **gain hands-on experience with the broader Ubuntu ecosystem**, including its strengths and trade-offs.

Kubuntu offered a good balance of usability, a comfortable desktop environment, and the opportunity to work with a different package management system—making it a straightforward choice for these study nodes.
