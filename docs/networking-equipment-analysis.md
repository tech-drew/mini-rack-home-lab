# Networking Equipment Analysis (Work in Progress)

**Notes:** In the past, I performed extensive research on networking equipment before choosing the solution for this home lab.

I evaluated the following platforms:
- Ubiquiti UniFi
- TP-Link Omada
- Ruckus
- MikroTik routing + Ubiquiti wireless mix
- MikroTik (final choice)

There were several technical, financial, and operational reasons that led me to choose MikroTik for routing (and potentially switching) in this setup.

I will dig up the information and detailed comparisons from my past research and add them to this document.
